Npm is used in almost every modern web development project. This article is part
of my knowledge management and is just a small summary of the following article:

[An Absolute Beginner's Guide to Using
npm](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/)

## `package.json` 🏡

manifest of your project. includes

- the packages and applications it depends on,
- information about its unique source control,
- and specific metadata (project's name, description, and author)

## `npm init`

step-by-step tool to create a `package.json` file. Can be used to kickoff a new
project.

## Managing Dependencies 📦

The main benefit of npm and the `package.json` file is that it contains a
collection of all project's dependencies.

- allows easy installation of given version
- allows separation between Dev and Prod environment

## `npm install` 📲

- packages and modules will be installed in the `./node_modules` subfolder
- `--save-dev` to install as Dev dependency
- `--global` to install globally on system

## `./node_modules` 🗂

- directory where project dependencies are installed/stored.
- dependencies don't have to be (and almost never should be)
  bundled with the project itself => Exclude this folder in the version
  control system

## yarn

- an alternative to npm
- developed by Facebook.
- Both are very similar.
- Nowadays both are deterministic (same package versions will be used
  on all installations).

## `package-lock.json`

- this file locks the dependencies to their exact versions (=> determinism)
- ensures the same file structure in node_modules
- should be add to the version control
- equivalent to `yarn.lock`

## Node.js 👾

is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that
executes JavaScript code. Meaning you can feed in Javascript code and Node is
able to run it on any operating system.

> npm is a package manager for JavaScript to manage the project's dependencies.
