I always wanted to have my own personal blog. Finally I had some time
to build it from scratch



# Requirements

This is my first blog ever and therefore I wasn't really sure what I can expect.
Unsually I when I start a new projects one of the first things I do is thinking
about my requirements.

I came up with the following expections/requirements:

- My blog should have a custom URL/domain.
  - (like `michaelhaar.dev` or `michaelhaar.at`).
- It should be minimalistic. 
  - (I thought I'll propably just need some code blocks and
images!?)
- I wanted to build it by myself.
  - (I was thinking of some HTML and CSS files which are stored in a github
  repository. Similar to the [Udacity Git Style Guide] which can be found
at Github under [udacity/git-styleguide].)
- I wanted to have a nice simplisitc welcome page.
- I don't allow any advertisements.
  - (Because I'm not planning to make any money with this blog.)
- Total costs should be less than 100€ per year


# Realization Steps 
## Buying a Domain

This step was really easy altough it was the first time that I bought a new 
domain. First, I searched for the `biggest domain registrars` on Google, which gave
me the following result:
- Domain.com
- Bluehost
- HostGator
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap
- DreamHost
- Shopify
- BuyDomains

After that I checked if the availability and the price of my desired domain name
on those sites. I ended up buying the domain name `michaelhaar.dev` at
[Namecheap] for approximately 12€-13€ per year including taxes and privacy
protection.

## Building the Blog Website.

As already mentioned in the requirements section I wanted to build the blog by 
myself or at least most parts of it. (I also tried [WordPress] but I
didn't like it.)

At first I wanted to write my blog posts directly in HTML and CSS, but I
realised that it might be difficult to be consistent with all the styles and
components. Therefore I decided to write my blog posts in markdown files and 
use Gatsby to convert them into static HTML/CSS/JS files, which can be easily 
distributed/hosted. Please check out my next blog post for more details about
how I did this.

After that, I searched for `Platforms to Host Static HTML Sites` on Google and
it gave me these results:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- Firebase
- Fast.io
- Render
- Gitlab
- GithubPages
- Amazon AWS Amplify

I decided to use Netlify, because it's has all the feature that I want (zero
costs, automatic deployment from Github and many Gatsby examples use Netlify).

## Changing the DNS

Computers in the internet can be addressed by their IP-adress which usually look
something like this `192.168.13.2`. Unfortunately these numbers are very hard to
remember for our human brains. Therefore we introduced domain names, which are
basically human friendly representations of the IP-adrresses. We can link the
domain name `michaelhaar.dev` to the IP-address of our Netlify server
by [changing the DNS]

# Testing

# Summary

Yaaay I did it! 

- First, I started by thinking about the requirements. 
- Then I bought the domain name `michaelhaar.dev`. 
- Next I created a new Github repository, added a Gatsby Blog
example, customized it and hosted the static HTML site on Netlify.
- Finally I had to link my domain name and the IP-address of the Netlify server
together by changing the DNS.
